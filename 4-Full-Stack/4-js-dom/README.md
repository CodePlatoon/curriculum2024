# DOM Events

## What are we trying to Accomplish?

By learning about the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to manipulate it with JavaScript, you aim to gain the essential skills for dynamically interacting with and modifying the content and structure of web pages. This knowledge enables you to create responsive and interactive websites by adding event listeners to HTML elements, which allows you to respond to user interactions, such as clicks, input, or other actions, and update the page's behavior and appearance in real-time, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and interactivity of web applications.
