# Intro to Object Oriented Programming Encapsulation and Abstraction

## What are we trying to accomplish?

Learning the difference between class and instance attributes, as well as understanding class, instance, and static methods, is crucial for developing effective and well-structured object-oriented programming (OOP) code. By the end of this lesson you'll have mastered the distinction between class and instance attributes and understanding class, instance, and static methods empowers you to design efficient, maintainable, and adaptable code.

## Topics Covered / Goals

- **Intermediate Object Oriented Programming:** Much of the value of OOP comes from calling instance methods on an object, which can refer to that object's specific data using `self` or `this`. However, there are other aspects of OOP that can be useful as well, such as, class methods, getters and setters.
- **Instance Attributes -vs- Class Attributes:** Understanding the different types of variables to use with Classes is important for encapsulating your data, so that data is available only where it needs to be.
- **Instance Methods -vs- Class Methods -vs- Static Methods:** Understanding the different types of methods to use with Classes is important for encapsulating your data, so that data is available only where it needs to be.
