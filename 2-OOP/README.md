# Intro to Object Oriented Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Instructor Notes & Prerequisites

All students should have Linux set up on their local dev environments. This is usually Mac OS X or for Windows users WSL2 w/its default Ubuntu. Non-Ubuntu distros are fine if the student knows what they are doing.

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in both JavaScript and Python, you aim to acquire a versatile understanding of how to structure and design code using OOP principles, enabling you to create more organized, maintainable, and scalable software solutions in both front-end and back-end development. Utilizing testing frameworks like Jest and Pytest enhances your ability to ensure the reliability and correctness of your OOP implementations, allowing you to confidently deploy applications with reduced risk of bugs and errors.

Additionally, learning to read and write CSV files with Python equips you with essential data manipulation skills, enabling you to handle structured data efficiently, whether it's for data analysis, reporting, or integration with various systems. Overall, mastering these topics empowers you to build robust and functional applications, while also boosting your problem-solving and analytical capabilities in various programming contexts.
