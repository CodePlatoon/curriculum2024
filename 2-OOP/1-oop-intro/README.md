# Intro to Object Oriented Programming with Python

## What are we trying to accomplish?

Everything in programming is interpreted as a class/object at it's most basic level making Object Oriented Programming(OOP) an essential skill for Junior Software Engineers. By the end of this lecture you'll learn the `4 pillars of pillars of OOP`, how to utilize `Pythons` elegant syntax and rich ecosystem to create multiple `Python Classes` and multiple `Instances of said classes`, and have an improved understanding of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

## Topics Covered / Goals

- **Intro to Object Oriented Programming:** Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a commonly used design paradigm. Python is an object oriented language, and so OOP is an essential piece of understanding Python.
- **Classes:** Classes are structures in code that allow for developers to create more elaborate data types that can better reflect real-world objects
- **Instantiating objects with \_\_init\_\_ and self:** Every class in Python should have an \_\_init\_\_ method, which tells python how to construct instances of that class. The instance to be created is referred to as `self`.
- **Instance methods and self:** Classes can define methods to be called by instances of that class, which can refer to themselves using the `self` keyword.
- **Dunder Methods:** These are special methods that are built-in to use within classes, in Python.
- **Getters and Setters:** Provide encapsulation for data in instances of our class, by separating the interface to our data from its internal representation.

## Testable Learning Objectives

- Constructing Classes in Python
- Constructing Initializers for Python Classes
- Constructing Class Dunder Methods
- Constructing Class Attributes
- Constructing Class Methods
- Constructing Class Attributes Getters and Setters (Encapsulation)

## Elective learning objectives

- Understand the Purpose and Value of OOP
- Understand the 4 Pillars of OOP
- Understand the Difference of Class Attributes and Class Methods
