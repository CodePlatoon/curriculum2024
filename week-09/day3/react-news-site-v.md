## Hooks:
Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. 


## useState()
A hook that allows you to give a component mutable state variables that can be used throughout the component while it is. 


### useState() syntax
```js


```


## useEffect()
The Effect Hook, useEffect, adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. 

It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes, but unified into a single API.

### useEffect() syntax
