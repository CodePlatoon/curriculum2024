# React Workshop

As a class we will work through Facebook's excellent [official React intro and tutorial](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html), 
and their ["Thinking In React"](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) guide.

However we will be building the learning projects in those guides using [functional components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) instead of class-based components, as the community is shiftting to functional components as the the norm.
