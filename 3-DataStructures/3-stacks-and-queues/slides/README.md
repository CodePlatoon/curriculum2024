# Slides

The slides are an HTML file. In your browser open the `index.html` file. You will see arrows in the bottom right corner you can use to page through the slides.

There is also an annotate feature and a whiteboard.

**You may find it easier to use the VS Code plugin mentioned below.**

Slides were generated using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)

Specifically with [this reveal.js vs code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evilz.vscode-reveal)

They were generated from the lesson markdown file. Each divider: `---` separates a new slide.

You can use the VS code plugin to generate fresh slides or a live slide preview in VS Code or in the browser.
