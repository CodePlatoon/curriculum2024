# Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists

## Instructor Notes & Prerequesites

While not necessary ideally big-o has been introduced prior to this lesson.

## What are we trying to accomplish?

These are fundamental data structures that are the building blocks of the programs that run the programs that run our programs.

They are valuable in case they appear on technical interviews, because familiarity with them is part of the common language of software engineers, because it will enhance your understanding of how computers work on a more fundamental level, and because, even if you don't implement them directly, these patterns are common ones you will see recur over time as you progress in your career.
