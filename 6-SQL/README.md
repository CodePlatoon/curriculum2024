# PostgreSQL

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By learning about SQL in PostgreSQL and psql, one aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of relational database management systems (RDBMS) and the tools required for effective data manipulation and querying. PostgreSQL, being a powerful open-source RDBMS, provides a robust platform for storing, organizing, and retrieving structured data. Through understanding SQL, the standard language for interacting with databases, and psql, the interactive terminal for PostgreSQL, individuals can efficiently perform tasks such as creating and managing databases, defining schemas, executing complex queries, and optimizing database performance. Ultimately, mastering SQL in PostgreSQL and psql equips individuals with essential skills for working with data, facilitating tasks ranging from basic data retrieval to advanced database administration and optimization.
