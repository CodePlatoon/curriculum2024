# SQL Queries, Using CSV and JSON files with Postgres

## What are we Trying to Accomplish?

You will learn about the most important Postgres data types - these are the types that our table columns can be.

You will learn how to write SQL queries to get the information you care about from a database. This is a useful skill in and of itself (especially if you are ever asked to get data for some report at work), but is also valuable because it will give you hands-on experience with relational databases and a strong 'mental model' for how they work.

It is also extremely important to be able to import and export data to and from our database. The `.csv` and `.json` file formats are *extremely* popular ways of formatting human-friendly text data. In particular, CSV is usually how spreadsheet data is exported, and, often how databases dump-export their data into text, so, it is particularly important to learn how to work with CSV files and Postgres.

It is not uncommon to have to design a data model/data schema with only a CSV file of data as your guide.
