# Weekly Topics:

- Data Structures
- Recursion
- Assessment #2 at end of the week!

# Lecture Videos:

- [Last year's Week 3 Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zai4ejbY6qQ&list=PLu0CiQ7bzwERaUcn4X0siMZjM2utG8Ggc&ab_channel=CodePlatoon)

# Why is it important?

- Data Structures is the field of 'solved' computer science related problems. We understand how different ways of structuring data can have different performance benefits, and this common ground knowledge tends to be relevant in the tech interview specifically.
- Recursion is important because it is often the most natural way to model or solve certain problems that would otherwise be practically unobtainable with an imperative approach. Recursion allows us to define a structure or algorithm in terms of itself, which mimics a kind of 'optimal substructure' some ways of modeling data have naturally, like trees.

# What you'll be able to accomplish after this topic?

1. Understand the basics of Data Structures and complexity analysis
2. Ability to use Recursions to solve challenges
3. An understanding of the Leetcode platform and how it can be used to practice for tech interviews.
