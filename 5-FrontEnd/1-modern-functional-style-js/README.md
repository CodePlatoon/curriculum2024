# Modern functional-style Javascript

## Instructor Notes & Prerequesites

Some previous JS programming experience is required; students should already be able to write and run JS programs locally and be comfortable writing programs in JS somewhat beyond the beginner level.

**The instructor should demo the beginning parts of the assignment (video store logic) as a tutorial during class time.**

## Lessons & Assignments

- [Lesson: Intro to the node ecosystem - node projects & npm, CommonJS Modules vs ESModules](./intro-to-node-ecosystem-modules.md)
  - [Assignment: Refactor a project to use ES Modules & add a feature](https://github.com/Code-Platoon-Assignments/nodejs-video-store-0)
- Lesson: Modern functional-style Javascript](./modern-js.md)
  - [Assignment: Create the logic for a video store using the tools we have learned](https://github.com/Code-Platoon-Assignments/video-store-0-functional-js-and-state)

## What are we trying to accomplish?

In preparation for working with React.js (a frontend JS UI framework) we will review JS, look at some more advanced coding styles which are the modern way of writing Javascript, and become more familiar with the tooling needed to manage different versions of node.js, install node packages, import/export Javascript from one file to another, and get a preview of the build tools (such as vite or create-react-app) needed to do modern frontend development.

## TLO's (Testable Learning Objectives)

### Basic proficiency with functional-style javascript

- Comfortable with arrow functions, object destructuring, array destructuring
- Able to use `.foreach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`
  - Over arrays with strings, numbers, and booleans
  - Over arrays containing objects or nested arrays - more complex data shapes
  - Able to do method chaining w/the above
  - Able to use all of the above to write nontrivial programs

### Node projects

- Create a new node project with npm
- Install npm modules as dependencies
- Able to create a basic `.gitignore` file for a node project 
- Basic use of Import/Export with CommonJS modules
- Run tests with jest
- Understand the standard node.js project structure  & best practice
- Create and run npm scripts
- Install & run an existing node.js project

### Importing / Exporting modules

- Understands that ESModules are best practice
- Able to set up a node project to use  ESModules
- Able to import/export with both CommonJS and ESModules

## ELO's (Elective Learning Objectives)

- Be able to read and understand a package.json file
- Able to identify the two different module systems (CommonJS/ES6Modules) and which is preferred/best practice.
