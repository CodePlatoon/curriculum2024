# Weekly Topics:

- Creating Single Page Applications (SPA) with React
- React hooks for adding functionality (useState, useEffect)
- Working with APIs in React using `axios`, JavaScript Promises, async/await
- Front-end routing with `react-router`
- E2E testing for web apps using `cypress`

# Lecture Videos:

> NOTE: Updates have since been made so this cohort's curriculum will differ slightly

# Why Is It Important?

- React is a JavaScript library that allows you to build Single Page Applications, or SPAs. An SPA differs from a traditional website in that it expects the user experience to be highly interactive and to _react_ to user changes or API calls seamlessly. This is an upgrade from traditional HTML/CSS/JS apps which assume you are building a static page and support for interactivity is limited.

- React is currently the most popular and most in-demand front-end framework, so it is a very marketable skill.

- React is an advanced JavaScript library so we will also be learning more advanced JS concepts along the way, like import/export syntax, destructuring, Promises and async/await.

# What you'll be able to accomplish after this topic:

1. use `vite` to bootstrap a React app
2. create a web frontend built out of React components
3. Understand and utilize the concepts of props to pass data in React from parent to child components
4. Understand and utilize the useState hook to maintain local state in your app
5. Understand and utilize the useEffect hook to communicate with APIs from the frontend
6. Understand and utilize destructuring in JS and use it to unpack complex objects
7. Understand how async works in JS and use Promises and async/await syntax to work with asynchronous tasks like making API calls

# Afternoon Breakout Sessions (optional):

1. Possible TypeScript session for those interested
2. Review session for Assessment 4

# Behavioral Question of the Week:

- "Tell me about a time where you had to work with a difficult person"
