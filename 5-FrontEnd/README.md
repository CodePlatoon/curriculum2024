# Front-End Development

## Instructor Notes & Prerequesites

Students should be able to comfortably write Javascript programs involving loops, objects, arrays, etc, and solve programming problems involving nested arrays, functions, and so on. Students should be familiar with the basic concepts of the web and HTML/CSS and a basic understanding of how a web server works, and how a backend web app works.

## What are we trying to accomplish?

You will learn modern frontend development - using React.js and Javascript to write single-page-apps (web apps) that run in the browser. You will be able to build the "front end" (the part of the web app running in the browser, the user interface, that people actually interact with) of a web app for common use cases and be able to get and send data from third party API's.

Many of the websites / apps you interact with in your browser on a daily basis - from Gmail to Facebook to Wikipedia to Youtube - are built using these same open-source technologies and frontend architecture patterns.

You will be able to explain how these applications are built and why they're built that way, and, become proficient in building them yourself using industry best practices.
