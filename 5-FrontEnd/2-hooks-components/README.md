# React Hooks and Components

## What are we Trying to Accomplish

By learning about React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`, as well as understanding components, you aim to become proficient in developing dynamic, interactive, and efficient user interfaces in React. These skills empower you to manage and update application state, handle side effects, create modular and reusable UI components, and ultimately build responsive and user-friendly web applications that are easier to develop, maintain, and scale.
