# Intro/Intermediate JS and unit testing with Jest

## What are we trying to accomplish?

By the end of this lecture you'll learn how to utilize JavaScript to solve programming tasks and some of the features and syntax unique to the language. Additionally, you'll learn how to utilize the `jest`, a JavaScript testing framework that allows us to test our code for correctness.

## Tangible Learning Objectives

n/a - all of the JS skills you learned will be needed in future assignments and assessments as we dive into the frontend and React.js, but your first Assessment (Assessment 1) will focus on Python. However if you don't take the time now to gain proficiency in these JS skills you will struggle later on.
