# Group Project: Experiment with sharing a Github repo

If anyone finishes all the introductory git/github assignments and wants more here is what we suggest:

1. Use slack to coordinate and group up.

2. Read [this article on the git feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).

3. Someone create a github repo and add everyone else in the group to it.

4. Practice having each person make their own feature branch of the main branch and then PR’ing it. Send each other PR’s and review/approve/merge each other’s PR’s.

There is plenty in the assignments to do today, so do not stress this. This is just for some folks who may have done some work with git prior to the class.

Groups that do this should let a TA know so they can help. Again, focus on the assignments. This is only if you are sitting staring at your computer feeling like you need more work to do.
