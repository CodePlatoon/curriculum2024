# Intro to Unix, TDD, Python, Pytest, JavaScript, Jest, and your Teams

## Instructor Notes & Prerequesites

All students should have Linux set up on their local dev environments. This is usually Mac OS X or for Windows users WSL2 w/its default Ubuntu. Non-Ubuntu distros are fine if the student knows what they are doing.

## What are we trying to accomplish?

Linux is the most widely-used operating system in the world, from embedded systems, IoT devices, wifi routers, nuclear submarines, and ... web servers and personal computers.

Almost all operating systems are running on some flavor of Linux, this week we will get familiarized with our terminals Command Line Interface by setting up our Linux Development Environment. Additionally we will cover the difference between git and github and how to maximize this tool to boost your personal and professional development throughout the program.

Lastly, we will cover the two most commonly used languages in the industry along with their respective popular test frameworks. This will allow you to understand and exercise Test Driven Development concepts and fundamentals to help you become an essential tool for the industry.
