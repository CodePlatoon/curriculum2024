# Intro to JS, Python, and the Tools of the Trade

## What are we trying to accomplish?

Modern software development is complex, and, writing code professionally requires using some specific tools and workflows. And while software is still a young field, there is a rich legacy of tools and programs that have become "standard" knowledge and which you can take advantage of.

You now will start learning how to use these professional tools, both to meet the standards of the industry and to improve your own productivity, workflow, and the quality of the software you write. 

You will also dive deeper in the Python and Javascript programming languages and begin to learn best practices for both those languages.

Most of all, you will begin to learn your "workbench" - your computer. Not only will you go deeper into Python, JS, and programming generally, but you will begin learning how to customize and configure your "dev environment" - your own machine.
Lastly, we will cover the two most commonly used languages in the industry along with their respective popular test frameworks. This will allow you to understand and exercise Test Driven Development concepts and fundamentals to help you become an essential tool for the industry.

### Linux

Linux is the most widely-used operating system in the world, from embedded systems, IoT devices, wifi routers, nuclear submarines, and ... web servers and personal computers.

Almost all operating systems are running on some flavor of Linux, this week we will get familiarized with our terminals Command Line Interface by setting up our Linux Development Environment. Additionally we will cover the difference between git and github and how to maximize this tool to boost your personal and professional development throughout the program.

### Git & Github

Git is an extremely popular "version control software", a powerful program that helps you to manage your code - keeping track of different "versions" of it, and it's history - as your projects get bigger. It has become an industry-standard tool.

You'll learn about git, start using it, and learn how Git and Github relate to each other and what their differences are.

### Javascript

Javascript (JS) is maybe the most popular programming language in the world, and the language of the web. It is **the** language for "frontend" web development. You'll begin to deepen your knowledge of JS.

### Python

Python is another popular programming language. It gets used for scientific computing, for machine learning (AI), and "backend" web app development. It is also a popular "teaching" language used to teach people how to program. Python is what's called an "Object Oriented Programming language" (OOP). You'll begin to deepen your knowledge of Python.

## Testing

As our programs get bigger, how do we know if they are working correctly? As we write software in teams, how do we ensure more errors don't slip into the software? 

Writing "tests" - programs to run our program, and test it is doing what it should, is one important part of writing high-quality and maintainable software.

Testing is a common practice regardless of the programming language and you'll learn how to do it with both Python and JS.

You'll also learn about **Test Driven Development**, or TDD. This is not only a testing strategy but a *programmer workflow* that can help you write code more productively & more enjoyably. It is extremely common in the industry and some knowledge of TDD or Testing is expected for most roles.
