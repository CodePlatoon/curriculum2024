# Intro to Django and Django ORM

## What are we trying to accomplish

By learning about Django Models, Model Fields and Methods, Django Model Fixtures, and the Django Admin Site, you are aiming to acquire a comprehensive understanding of how to design, structure, and interact with a relational database in web applications using the Django framework. This encompasses creating and customizing data models, defining various fields and methods to manipulate and retrieve data efficiently, utilizing fixtures for populating the database with sample data, and effectively using the Django Admin Site to manage and manipulate data through a user-friendly interface. This knowledge empowers you to build robust, data-driven web applications with efficient data management, manipulation, and presentation capabilities.
